# Gameofthrones
Welcome to our MVC-SQL-CRUD project

Our week 8 project required we make a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project using information from a database instead of a .csv or .txt file.


## Application description 
Here the user is taken to the home page of our site. The function of the site is to be able to search for characters in, "Game of Thrones" by first name, last name, nickname, or house name.
You can then edit, create, or delete characters.
